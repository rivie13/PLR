Projectile Launcher Rework

Hi everyone. I have finally found the time to rework my original mod and now that I have a new file structure I will be changing my whole GitHub project here.

This mod reworks the projectile launcher weapon in Cyberpunk 2077

Including more variants, adding new rounds to the game, eventually new fragments, and hopefully more detailed tuning stats for each launcher.

This mod comprises of using lua (which needs to be updated badly), JSON, YAML, and a C like scripting language REDScript.

To download this mod one can download the zip file that is provided here.

To add this mod to your cyberpunk game: extract the zip file and look for the packed folder. In there, there will be 3 folders archive, bin, and r6. Take those folders and dump them into the main directory of your Cyberpunk game (/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk 2077)

If you have downloaded my old mod then you will probably have to delete it which will be at (Cyberpunk 2077/bin/x64/plugins/cyber_engine_tweaks/mods/Projectile Launcher Rework) just delete that whole folder.

If you have any other mods that create projectile launcher rounds or edit the projectile launcher you should probably delete those.

This mod should work with the dilingspam projectile launcher effects mod (sorry if I spelled your name wrong)
