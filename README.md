Projectile Launcher Rework

Hi everyone. I have finally found the time to rework my original mod and now that I have a new file structure I will be changing my whole GitHub project here.

This mod reworks the projectile launcher weapon in Cyberpunk 2077

Including more variants, adding new rounds to the game, eventually new fragments, and hopefully more detailed tuning stats for each launcher.

This mod comprises of using lua (which needs to be updated badly), JSON, YAML, and a C like scripting language REDScript.
