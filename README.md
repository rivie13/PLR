Projectile Launcher Rework

Hi everyone. I have finally found the time to rework my original mod and now that I have a new file structure I will be changing my whole GitHub project here.

This mod reworks the projectile launcher weapon in Cyberpunk 2077

Including more variants, adding new rounds to the game, eventually new fragments, and hopefully more detailed tuning stats for each launcher.

This mod comprises of using lua (which needs to be updated badly), JSON, YAML, and a C like scripting language REDScript.

To add this mod to your cyberpunk game: extract the zip file and look for the packed folder. In there, there will be 3 folders archive, bin, and r6. Take those folders and dump them into the main directory of your Cyberpunk game (/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk 2077)

If you have downloaded my old mod then you will probably have to delete it which will be at (Cyberpunk 2077/bin/x64/plugins/cyber_engine_tweaks/mods/Projectile Launcher Rework) just delete that whole folder.

If you have any other mods that create projectile launcher rounds or edit the projectile launcher you should probably delete those.

This mod should work with the dilingspam projectile launcher effects mod (sorry if I spelled your name wrong)


To download the wolvenkit process and work on it yourself through wkit:

This is recommended for people who at least have a small background with modding/wkit/computer science stuff. If you want to learn from it you are more than welcome to do so as well but it may be a little confusing. If you have questions please feel free to ask and I will do my best to answer.

Download the PLR2.0 (the one without the underscore _ in it) zip folder

go to wkit and go to open project.

find the project and then there you go.


To download the easy download package:

this is recommended for most users/players. this is essentially the drag and drop method.

download the PLR_2.0 (notice the underscore) zip folder.

extract the zip folder and then take the contents and drop them into your Cyberpunk2077 main directory.
  - the archive, bin, and r6 folders are the folders you need to drop into the directory.
  - your main cyberpunk2077 directory is in whatever drive you put your game on
  - SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk2077 is what you are looking for.

This should overwrite any previous Projectile Launcher Rework mods that you had if they were made by me previously.

JUST TO BE SAFE!!!

You should go into your bin, r6, and archive directories and look for any mods that deal with the projectile launchers, either adding them or adding rounds or anything else of that nature, those files must be deleted. If you don't do this, it could potentially cause this and other mods to not work properly, could cause crashes etc. so make sure to do this!!!


What this mod does:

In a nutshell, the launcher was extremely underpowered in the base game. So I decided to give it a buff. 
This is done through giving a player control over many different aspects of damage amount and damage range through a menu with sliders. 
There are also many quality of life/ game improvement changes made. These include creating new variants of the launcher that can be used 
earlier in the game with the right amount of money. There are now quality restrictions on what rounds and what fragments can be attached to what launcher. 
All of the launchers now have new base rounds that I have created myself.
There are also other new rounds that I have created myself and then different variants of already created rounds.
Some of the rounds that were in the original game will not act like you would expect them to but that will be for you to find out.


Future Plans:

More rounds, more fragments, more settings, improved menu (big maybe), more launcher types?

I have been working on this for about a month and should have posted more on Github but at least I'm doing it now.

Thanks for reading all of this and if you have any questions just ask and I'll do my best to answer.
